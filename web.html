            <h2>AI in Education Quiz</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This project is an interactive quiz website that explores the theme of AI in Education, designed to inform users about the role and impact of artificial intelligence within educational settings. The quiz is user-friendly and includes a unique "Cheat Mode" feature, allowing users to reveal correct answers with detailed explanations if needed. Visual elements like an animated cat add a fun, interactive touch, making the quiz both engaging and informative.</p>
            <p><strong>Creation Process:</strong> The quiz was created using Notepad for code editing and writing in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML and CSS were used to structure and style the quiz interface, while JavaScript enabled the interactive quiz functionality. The project was tested locally before being published on GitHub Pages, which provides free static web hosting and makes the site accessible to users.</p>
            <p><strong>Tools:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Notepad: Used as the primary code editor to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
                <li>HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the quiz interface.</li>
                <li>JavaScript: For implementing quiz logic, managing user feedback, and adding interactive animations.</li>
                <li>GitHub Pages: Used to host the project and share it online.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Drag-and-Drop Quiz -->
        <section>
            <h2>AI in Education Drag-and-Drop Quiz</h2>
            <p>This project transforms a traditional drag-and-drop quiz into an interactive and visually engaging experience, with the theme focused on “AI in Education.” Below are the details of the updates I made, including the theme modification, CSS improvements, and enhanced user interactivity.</p>
            <h3>1. Theme Change to “AI in Education”</h3>
            <p><strong>Concept Update:</strong> I updated it to focus on “AI in Education,” a modern and relevant topic in educational technology. This theme helps users explore and understand how AI is applied in educational contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Categories and Concepts:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personalized Learning:</strong> Concepts like “Adaptive Learning” and “Personalized Study Path” help students receive customized educational experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Assessment:</strong> Includes concepts such as “Automated Grading” and “AI-based Feedback,” highlighting AI’s role in grading and feedback automation.</li>
                <li><strong>Teaching Assistance:</strong> Concepts like “Virtual Tutor” and “Teacher Support Tools” illustrate how AI can support educators in their teaching tasks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. CSS Styling Enhancements</h3>
            <p>I made the following updates to the CSS to improve the quiz's visual appeal and usability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soft Color Scheme and Shadows:</strong> Introduced a professional and modern color palette with softer tones that enhance readability and reduce visual strain.</li>
                <li><strong>Rounded Corners:</strong> Added border-radius to draggable items and drop zones, creating a smoother, approachable interface.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Layout Adjustments:</strong> Optimized the layout to ensure it is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Interactivity Improvements</h3>
            <p>To make the quiz experience more engaging and intuitive, I added:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hover Effects and Enlargement:</strong> Draggable items slightly enlarge on hover, giving users a clear indication of interactivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Change on Drop Zones:</strong> Drop zones highlight when hovered over, making the interface more intuitive.</li>
                <li><strong>Scroll Functionality for Overflowing Lists:</strong> Added a scroll bar to keep the interface clean while accommodating more content.</li>
            </ul>
